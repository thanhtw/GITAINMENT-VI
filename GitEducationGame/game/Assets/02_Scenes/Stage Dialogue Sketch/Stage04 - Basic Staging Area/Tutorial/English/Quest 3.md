Great job!
You have successfully executed the 'git status' command.

After execution, the 'Staging Area' window appeared on the screen.
Let's understand the contents of it.

In this window, it shows the file differences
between the 'Working Directory' and the 'Staging Area'.

In the 'Unstaged Files' area,
you'll find files that have been added, modified, or deleted in the 'Working Directory'.

These files are seen as 'untracked' by the Git system
when the content has been '<color=#CF001C>changed</color>' but not moved to the 'Staging Area' yet.

Also, the plus icon is in the first line of the list.
This means the file 'Class_Notes.txt' is being tracked for the first time for the Git management system,

The 'Staged Files' area represents the files we've added to the 'Staging Area'.
They are ready to save as a record.

After confirming all the files we want to record,
we can move the 'Staged' content to the 'Repository' at once to create a 'commit'.

After we understand the structure of the 'Staging Area',
let's try to add files to it.
We'll use the command '<color=#CF001C>git add</color>' to achieve this.

In the 'git add' command,
you need to include the filename you want to upload.

There's a file on the computer.
We can add it using '<color=#CF001C>git add Class_Notes.txt</color>'.

Before we start,
let me introduce another feature in the 'Command Line' window.

The search function of the 'Command Line' window,
it can also fill in the file name in the input field quickly.

To use this feature, please follow these steps:

1. Enter '<color=#CF001C>git add</color>' in the input field.

2. Add a space after the command, become:
   '<color=#CF001C>git add </color>'.

3. Press the search feature button or the Tab key.
   The system will display all file names in the current path.
   Choose the file you want to add.

Now, please follow the above steps and execute the
'<color=#CF001C>git add Class_Notes.txt</color>' command.
